Looks like our boost was configured without mpi, but adding it doesn't seem hard.
 
Can you point your include & lib directives to subdirectories of 
 
/work/00434/eijkhout/boost/installation
 
There is only one mpi library that I can see, so you can add "-lboost_mpi" to your link line.
 
Let me know if there is a problem. I may have missed a permission of so.
 
Victor.
